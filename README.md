# GameActions
GameActions is a set of easy to use scripts that can be used to reduce custom scripts to do basic operations like moving objects. It simplifies basic actions and makes them modular in a way that they can be edited in the scene without editing a script.

# Getting started
Checkout the Examples to get started. Here's some brief info.

## An action
An action instance does _something_ when its Act or StartActing method gets called.

## Container actions - ActionSet and ActionSequence
An action that calls the Act method of its level-1 children, all at once (ActionSet), or one by one in order (ActionSequence).
